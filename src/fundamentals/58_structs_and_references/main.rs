/*

    Create a struct called TextFinder that holds a reference to a string slice.
    The struct should have a constructor new() that takes a string slice and returns a TextFinder instance.
    The struct should have a method called find_first that returns the first line containing the keyword, or None if no match is found.
    The struct should have a method called find_many that returns a vector of all lines containing the keyword.
    The search functionality should be case-sensitive.
    Ensure you return references to the original string slice rather than creating new owned strings.
*/

// 1. Define the struct
pub struct TextFinder<'a> {
    text: &'a str,
}

// 2. Implement the struct and define the methods

// Example usage
pub fn main() {
    let text = "Rust is fast and memory-efficient.\nOwnership is key to Rust's safety.\nRustaceans love the borrow checker.";
    let finder = TextFinder::new(text);

    let first = finder.find_first("Rust");
    println!("{:?}", first); // Should print: Some("Rust is fast and memory-efficient.")

    let matches = finder.find_many("Rust");
    println!("{:?}", matches); // Should print: ["Rust is fast and memory-efficient.", "Ownership is key to Rust's safety."]
}
